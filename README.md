# Stable-baselines-3-Introduction

Install the following packets: "torch","stable-baselines3","box2d-py","pyglet" (1.5.27),"opencv-python", "tensorboard" and "gym"

the tutorial can be found at the following link:
https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-reinforcement-learning-stable-baselines-3-tutorial/

The first two intros are about:
- intro1 -> Reinforcement learning with the env "LunarLander"
- intro2 -> Reinforcement learning with the env "LunarLander" using POP and A2C algorithms (+ tensorboard for comparisons)

In particular, the third intro is about a customized game where:
- intro3.py is the game itself in python -> snake the game
- intro3RLgame.py is the RL classes and environment 
- intro3checkEnv.py is just to check if there are mistakes
- intro3final.py is about training the model in the new env
